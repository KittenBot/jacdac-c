## TODO

### General purpose?

* simply `[A|B|C|D] := Rn` ?
  -> verify is tricky - make sure assumptions all right?

* extensibility? in C (possibly via services) or in compiler?

* add integer registers
* integer arithmetic
* integer variables?

* what about analysis?
* integer vs float regs; good idea? maybe only one set of regs - operations decide how to interpret
